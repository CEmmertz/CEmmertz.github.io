        <h2>My freshman year of high school I went to Falmouth High School in Maine. But, the summer after my freshman year my family moved to Hampstead, a town on the coast of North Carolina. The next 3 years I attended Topsail High School and played baseball there. Our team was very good and I made many lifelong friends during my time there. </h2>

        <h2>Last fall, I was playing for ETSU when I felt something pop in my shoulder. I got an MRI and I found out that I had a tear in my labrum. I played through the pain during the season, but ended up getting surgery this summer. I have been doing a lot of physical thereapy and builing strength back up in my shoulder. I started hitting a couple weeks ago and I start throwing again in less than two weeks. </h2>
